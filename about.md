## About Me

I am a recent graduate in Information Technology with prior professional experience as a Software Engineer. I have over two years of experience working on backend development using Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and cloud technologies, contributing across the full software development lifecycle.

My experience includes building and maintaining RESTful APIs, integrating backend services with relational and search-based data stores, and supporting CI/CD pipelines in cloud environments. I am comfortable working in Agile teams and collaborating with QA, DevOps, and support teams to deliver reliable software solutions.

I am currently seeking an entry-level Software Engineer role where I can continue to grow my backend and system design skills while learning new technologies and contributing to scalable, data-driven applications.
