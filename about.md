## About Me

I am a recent graduate with a strong academic foundation in data analytics and data visualization, combined with three years of professional experience as a Software Engineer. Through my education and industry experience, I have developed a solid understanding of how data, systems, and applications work together to support business and technical goals.

In my previous role, I worked across different stages of the software development lifecycle and gained experience collaborating with cross-functional teams. I enjoy problem-solving, breaking down complex challenges, and finding practical solutions. I am a quick learner who adapts well to new tools, technologies, and environments.

I am currently seeking opportunities in a challenging and growth-oriented environment where I can continue to develop my technical skills, take on new responsibilities, and contribute meaningfully to the team and organization.
